# My nixox dotfiles readme

Here is my dotfiles for my xixos machine. The setup instructions are from LibrePhoenix:

- [Flake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACybVzRvDhs&list=FLximN2Dc_dZcDTfC7BNaVUw&index=2&t=8s)
- [Home-manger stand alone configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiyBeR-Guqw&list=FLximN2Dc_dZcDTfC7BNaVUw&index=1)

## Enable flakes in nixos

Basically to anable flakes we need to add the following line to the /etc/configuration.nix:

```
nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
```

Once done just rebuild the system for the modification to take affect:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

From now we have acees to flakes commands and we can:

- update nix flake with `nix flake update`
- rebuild the system with the repository stated in flake.nix with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`

## Enable home-manager

For unstable channel execute theese commands (taken from home manager official manual):

- `nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager`
- `nix-channel --update`
  to update and pool the channel but for the actual installation run:
- `nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install`
  If you recive an error like 'file home-manager was not found in the Nix search path' just log out and log in again and run the command again.

## integrate Home manager with flake in dotfile directory

Inserte home manager in inputs and ouputs on flake.nix file

## Use home manger

Edit the file home .nix to configure your applications and configuration at user level. Than run the following command to sync the state of the system with the file: `home-manager switch --flake .`
If you recive an error please be sure git treee is cleaned so that all files are tracked `git add . `

## Summary

To update the system, navigate to the dotfile directory and run

```
nix flake update
```

This command will upate the .lock files so that all the switch command will use the updates packages versions. To actual update the system run

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

To update the user config use

```
home-manager switch --flake .
```

## Maintenance

We can delete all generations (except the last one) with the following command:

```
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
```

To check the result use the following:

```
sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --list-generations
```

the command lists all the available configurations.
